# pancakeswap-arb bot

PancakeSwap has a price prediction game(https://pancakeswap.finance/prediction), and I notice that the payout of Bull and Bear often differ a lot. Apart from that, the chainlink price feed is slower than the Cex price update since the former feeds the price every 21 seconds while people trade BNB in Cex non-stop. Therefore, there might be a small arbitrage opportunity. This bot bets and claims rewards automatically. 

You need a BSC address, its private key, and an RPC link for this bot.

This bot is my first web3 project which is for education purposes only. You must consider the risk before using this bot.
