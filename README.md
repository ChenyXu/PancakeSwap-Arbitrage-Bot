# pancakeswap-arb bot

PancakeSwap has a betting game and I notice that the payout of Bull and Bear often differ a lot. Apart from that, the chainlink price feed is slower than the cex price update since the former feeds the price every 21 seconds and people trade BNB in cexs non-stop. Therefore, I think there might be a small arbitrage opportunity. This bot bets and claims rewards automatically.
